                        <p class="paragraph">I hope this message finds you in good health. I am Zeeshan Haider. I hail from Lahore and graduated as a Mechanical Engineer from UET Lahore. 
                        Subsequently, I began my career as a research engineer at Cerad (Center for Energy Research 
                        and Development). In this role, I developed various CAD assemblies and oversaw their manufacturing processes. 
                        Later, I transitioned to the industrial sector, serving as an assistant development manager in an automotive 
                        company is a pivotal role within the organization.

                            Throughout my four years at the university, I actively engaged in weekend projects. 
                            I had the honor of representing Pakistan twice in an international event organized by 
                            ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers). ASME releases a yearly problem statement, 
                            leading to Student Design contests at the local and country levels. Winners of local contests 
                            qualify for the final round in the USA. Our team participated in the SDC organized by GIKI, 
                            winning at the Pakistan level and qualifying for the final round in Houston, Texas in 2015. 
                            The subsequent year, our team excelled once again, reaching the final round in Phoenix, Arizona. 
                            One of my most captivating projects involved designing and developing an Ornithopterâ€”a bionic flying 
                            bird. I proposed a unique theory on bird flight, derived my own thrust and lift equations, 
                            and successfully manufactured the complete bird to validate my theories.

                            Shifting gears to my transition to the software field, the pandemic brought challenges, 
                            leading me to reevaluate my career path during lockdowns and widespread layoffs. 
                            Consulting with my brother, a fullstack developer in a Silicon Valley-based company, 
                            I decided to venture into coding. Coding soon became my passion, prompting a full switch 
                            to the software field with a focus on Python.

                            To establish a robust theoretical foundation, I undertook C++ assignments and lab projects at FAST 
                            University Lahore. Furthering my knowledge in areas such as Object-Oriented Programming, data structures, 
                            and memory management, I completed courses in both frontend and backend development. Practical experience 
                            followed through internships, including a six-month stint at Folio3, where I earned a Gold badge in problem-solving 
                            on HackerRank and Python. Additionally, I learned Flask and developed REST APIs for a hiring system. Subsequently, a 
                            three-month internship at Inaequo Solutions honed my skills in front-end technologies like JavaScript and React, 
                            culminating in my position as a Trainee Engineer.
